# RAISING EXCEPTIONS
An exception is a kind of object in Ruby, a special kind of object that signals
some type of exceptional conditional. Ruby has several pre-defined classes to
help handle error conditions. These include the Exception class and all of its
several children. When an exception condition occurs, an exception is raised,
and Ruby programs terminate by default.
