# EXTERNAL CLASSES AND MODULES
You can call external classes using load, require, or require_relative and you
'mix in' modules using include, extend, or prepend.

Mixing modules in means that instances of the class have access to instance
methods defined in the module. So what you get is organized code by composition,
rather than inheritance.

to run this demo type:
ruby classes_and_modules


We'll use require and include/extend. For a full discussion on mixing in and loading
classes, see this url:
