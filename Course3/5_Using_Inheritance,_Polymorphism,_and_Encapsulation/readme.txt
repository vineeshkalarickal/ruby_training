# INHERITANCE
Objects are intrinsically hierarchical in real life and in Ruby. When an object
in Ruby inherits behavior from a super or parent class, then it is bestowed with
that same behavior.

# POLYMORPHISM
Polymorphism occurs when a class that inherits from a parent class overrides the
behavior provided by the parent or super class.

# ENCAPSULATION
Encapsulation simply means that the internal representation of an object is
hidden from the outside. Encapsulation represents a pattern for capturing an
object and only exposing those components that are necessary for interacting
with it.
